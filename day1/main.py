# Create a Band Name Generator

# 1. Create a greeting:
print("Hello, welcome to Band Name Generator, let's get started!\n", "-"*30)

# 2. Ask for the name of the city they grew up in:
city_name = input("What is the name of the city you grew up in?\n")

# 3. Ask for the name of a pet:
pet_name = input("What is the name of a pet you had?\n")

# 4. Combine the name of the city and the name of the pet and show the name of the band:
print("-"*30, "\nThe name of your band can be: "+city_name+" "+pet_name)
